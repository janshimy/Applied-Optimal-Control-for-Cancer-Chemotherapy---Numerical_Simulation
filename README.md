# Numerical_Simulation
This MATLAB scripts implements the numerical simulation for dynamical systems - Optimal control Applied to cancer chemotherapy. 

# Research objectives
The main objective is to apply the optimal control to study and develop optimal
strategies for chemotherapy. The objective is achieved by formulating and solving the Optimal
Control Problem OCP where the goal is to find the control u(t) that will drive the tumor
density to a desired level Nd and minimizes the side effects of the drug.

# Methodology
The main tool used is Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. We assumed Gompertzian
growth and used Skipper’s log-kill hypothesis
• Derivation and theoretical analysis of necessary conditions for optimality.
• Writing Matlab codes for implementation
• Analysis of different scenarios including input parameters, controls, and sensitivity
analysis.
• Adding the final payoff to the objective functional with only running cost.
• Discussing the impact of adding this terminal cost to the objective functional.
